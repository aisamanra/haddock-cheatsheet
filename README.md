# Important note

This cheatsheet has been migrated into the [official Haddock repo](https://github.com/haskell/haddock/tree/ghc-8.10/doc/cheatsheet) and can also be viewed [in the Haddocks for Haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock). Please track the version there for any changes or updates.

# Haddock Markup Quick Reference

This page is a single-page quick reference for the markup used in GHC's [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation format. It doesn't list all the details of the format, just the basic markup, so for the vagaries and edge-cases of the syntax, it would be helpful to consult the [Haddock user guide](http://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
